# Traditional Tết in Vietnam

This project celebrates Tết (Tết Nguyên Đán), the Vietnamese Lunar New Year. Tết is the most important holiday in Vietnam, marking a fresh start through family reunions, ancestral remembrance, and wishes for health, luck, and prosperity. Homes are cleaned and decorated, altars are prepared, and people pay respect to their ancestors before stepping into the new year.

Common Tết symbols include apricot blossoms in the South, peach blossoms in the North, kumquat trees, red-and-gold lucky envelopes, and traditional foods like bánh chưng and bánh tét. The festival blends ancient customs with joyful modern gatherings, fireworks, and community celebrations.
